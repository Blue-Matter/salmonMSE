\title{Example performance metrics}
\usage{
PNI75(SMSE, Ref = 0.75, Yrs = NULL)

WILD50(SMSE, Ref = 0.5, Yrs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{SMSE}{SMSE object returned by \code{\link[=salmonMSE]{salmonMSE()}}}

\item{Ref}{Threshold for the performance metric, used to calculate the probability that the metric exceeds this value}

\item{Yrs}{Numeric vector of length 2 to indicate the year range over which to summarize performance.
If NULL, the performance is summarized over all projection years.}
}
\value{
A vector of probabilites corresponding to population
}
\description{
Functions that evaluate return probabilities of outcomes from the simulations.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \code{PNI75} calculates the probability that PNI exceeds 0.75
\item \code{WILD50} calculates the probability that at least 50 percent of natural spawners are wild
}
