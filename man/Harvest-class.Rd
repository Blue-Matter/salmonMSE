\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{Name}}{Character. Identifying name}

\item{\code{u_preterminal}}{Numeric. The exploitation rate of the immature stock in the pre-terminal fishery.}

\item{\code{u_terminal}}{Numeric. The exploitation rate of the return in the terminal fishery.}

\item{\code{m}}{Numeric. The mark rate of hatchery origin fish, which affects fishery selectivity. Mark-selective fishing (MSF) is implemented if \code{m > 0}.}

\item{\code{release_mort}}{Vector length 2. The proportion of released fish that die after release, in the pre-terminal and terminal fishery.
Implemented to model mark-selective fishing. Not used if \code{m = 0}.}

\item{\code{vulPT}}{Vector length \code{maxage}. Vulnerability schedule (between 0-1) in the preterminal fishery.}

\item{\code{vulT}}{Vector length \code{maxage}. Vulnerability schedule (between 0-1) in the terminal fishery.}
