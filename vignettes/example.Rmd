Here, we show a simple example of a salmon operating model where all fish mature at age 3 and follows the structure of an analysis done in AHA.

We create several S4 objects, the `Bio` object contains the natural biological dynamics, including the maturity ogive `p_mature`, fecundity, as well as the density-dependent survival of smolts through the capacity and productivity parameters (`capacity_smolt` and `prod_smolt`, respectively).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(salmonMSE)

class?SOM # Definition of inputs

Bio <- new(
  "Bio",
  nsim = 3,
  maxage = 3,
  p_mature = c(0, 0, 1),
  SRrel = "BH",
  capacity_smolt = 17250,   # Beverton-Holt asymptote
  prod_smolt = 300,         # Equal to prod_adult/SAR
  SAR_NOS = 0.01,           # Future feature allows for time-varying SAR
  fec = 5040,               # Spawning fecundity of female NOS and HOS
  p_female = 0.49           # Proportion female of spawners
)
```

The next three objects control the management of the conservation unit through habitat, hatchery, and harvest options.

Let's leave the habitat unchanged from the `Bio` object:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Habitat <- new(
  "Habitat",
  capacity_smolt_improve = 1,    # Keep carrying capacity unchanged
  prod_smolt_improve = 1         # Keep productivity unchanged
)
```

The hatchery dynamics are the most complex. 
We have a management target to release 2 million subyearlings. 

After specifying the survival of broodtake and the eggs in the hatchery, the model calculates the target broodtake.
The natural broodtake (NOB) is the product of the natural escapement and `ptarget_NOB`, and capped at the product of natural escapement and `pmax_NOB`.

The hatchery origin broodtake (HOB) is the difference between NOB and target broodtake, and cannot exceed available broodtake, which is the product of hatchery escapement and `premove_HOS`. The latter is the proportion of hatchery origin escapement removed for hatchery or research purposes, or to remove from the spawning grounds to ensure a high proportion of natural spawners.

We also need to specify the relative fecundity of HOS compared to NOS, and the fitness dynamics.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Hatchery <- new(
  "Hatchery",
  n_yearling = 0,                   # Management lever. No hatchery if both this line and next line are zero
  n_subyearling = 2e6,              # Management lever. No hatchery if both this line and previous line are zero
  s_prespawn = 1,                   # Survival prior to spawning
  s_egg_smolt = 1e-6,               # Survival of eggs in hatchery
  s_egg_subyearling = 0.92,
  SAR_HOS = Bio@SAR_NOS,
  gamma = 0.8,
  pmax_NOB = 0.7,
  ptarget_NOB = 0.51,
  phatchery = 0.8,
  premove_HOS = 0,
  theta = c(100, 80, 70),
  rel_loss = c(0.5, 0.4, 0.1),
  fec_brood = 5040,
  fitness_type = "Ford",
  pbar_start = c(93.1, 92),
  fitness_variance = 10,
  selection_strength = 3,
  heritability = 0.5,
  fitness_floor = 0.5
)
```

We specify a harvest rate of 0.203 for the terminal fishery (mature component). No hatchery fish are marked.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Harvest <- new(
  "Harvest",
  u_preterminal = 0,   # No fishery on juveniles
  u_terminal = 0.203,  # Specify fixed harvest rate of mature fish in the terminal fishery
  m = 0,               # Mark rate of hatchery releases
  release_mort = c(0.1, 0.1)
)
```

Now let's stitch together the operating model and run the simulation for 50 years.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
SOM <- new(
  "SOM",
  proyears = 50,
  Bio, Habitat, Hatchery, Harvest
)
SMSE <- salmonMSE(SOM)
```

With a simple salmon model, we can run AHA and compare the trajectory of the population. 

AHA starts the projection with 1,000 NOS and HOS, while salmonMSE starts with the natural smolt production predicted by the intersection of the one-to-one line and the stock-recruit relationship, and no hatchery fish.
Nevertheless, the number of NOS in both models stabilizes to the equilibrium value after approximately 15 generations (45 years).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
SAHA <- AHA(SOM, ngen = 20)

# Compare NOS
SAHA$NOS
SMSE@NOS[, 1, ]
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/example-NOS.png")
```
