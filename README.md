salmonMSE is a decision-support tool for Pacific salmon focusing on
strategic trade-offs among harvest, hatchery and habitat management
levers.

Funding for the development of salmonMSE is provided through the
[Pacific Salmon Strategy
Initiative](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/campaign-campagne/pss-ssp/index-eng.html)
in collaboration with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada.
